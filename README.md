# nokogiri-bug-reproduction-1
Shows how to reproduce bug as described in Nokogiri issue: https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/3128

Run as a pure ruby script: ruby main.rb

Not really necessary anymore: issue was actually on our application's side, not Nokogiri's side.

Just adding for completeness
